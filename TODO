### KNOWN BUGS:

1. Occasionnaly trades would not be correclty cancelled.
    (Coinbase seems to cancel orders always OK; what other exchanges fail occasionnaly?)
      ((After looking at it, It seems more likely that a trade can be left behind when tribeca crashes.))

2. Under EwmaBasic, when the TBP reaches 0 or the total size of the portfolio, it gets stuck there forever.
    (not sure if a bug or a feature, pending investigation!)

3. Orders do not last more than a few miliseconds on OkCoin.
    (not sure if a bug or a feature, pending investigation!)

4. Browserify does not minify es6 yet, so bundle.min.js is not really minified.

5. ag-grid css is also not minified.

6. TradesComponent.updateQP does nothing (but is harmless so low priority).

7. TradesComponent.addRowData does not sort new records by sortTime (but is harmless so low priority).

### TODO:

-1. Concurrent exchanges

0. Display charts and chat room

1. Add new exchanges

2. Add new, smarter trading strategies (as always!)

3. Support for currency pairs which do not trade in $0.01 increments (LTC, DOGE)

4. More documentation

5. More performant UI
