### KNOWN BUGS:

1. Occasionnaly trades would not be correclty cancelled.
    (Coinbase seems to cancel orders always OK; what other exchanges fail occasionnaly?)

2. Under EwmaBasic, when the TBP reaches 0 or the total size of the portfolio, it gets stuck there forever.

3. Orders do not last more than a few miliseconds on OkCoin.

4. Browserify does not minify es6 yet, so bundle.min.js is not really minified

5. TradesComponent.updateQP does nothing (but is harmless so low priority).

6. TradesComponent.addRowData doesn't not sort new records by sortTime (but is harmless so low priority).

### TODO:

-1. Concurrent exchanges

0. Display charts and chat room

1. Add new exchanges

2. Add new, smarter trading strategies (as always!)

3. Support for currency pairs which do not trade in $0.01 increments (LTC, DOGE)

4. More documentation

5. More performant UI
